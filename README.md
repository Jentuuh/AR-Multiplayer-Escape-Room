# AR-Multiplayer-Escape-Room
This Android AR Multiplayer game was made by me and 2 other classmates during a Software development and project skills project. 

The game exists of 4 levels, each set in a different theme and with different puzzles. Each player will take the role of a character of their choice (in multiplayer levels) and will need to co-operate and combine the strengths of each team member to complete the level. Players can communicate with each other using a textual chat. They can also transfer items between each other using a shared inventory.

You can play the game at any location (although some levels require walls for a good experience), in any room. Before the game starts, each player will need to initialize their room and place 'object containers' around the room in order to do so.

We developed the application in Unity using Google's ARCore framework and Photon PUN 2 framework for networking functionality.

Here's a little [preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD2tUd2vk1c&t=) of the application in action.

# Usage
If you'd like to try out the app for yourself (or just view the project in Unity) : 

--> Clone this project to your PC 

--> Download Unity (we used version 2018.4.17) 

--> Open Unity Hub 

--> Under 'Projects', click 'ADD' 

--> Find the directory in which you saved our cloned project 

--> Go to Assets > Scenes and open one of the scenes you see (NOT the .meta files!) 

--> This should load in the whole project into Unity
